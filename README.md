- `property_id`: References the property being reviewed
- `rating`: Numerical rating (e.g., 1–5)
- `comment`: Text review

### 🔹 Payments
Represents payment transactions related to bookings.

**Key Fields:**
- `id`: Unique identifier for each payment
- `booking_id`: References the booking being paid for
- `amount`: Payment amount
- `payment_method`: Type of payment (e.g., credit card, PayPal)
- `status`: Status of the payment (e.g., completed, pending)

---

### 🔗 Entity Relationships

- A **User** can have multiple **Properties** (if they are a host).
- A **User** can make multiple **Bookings** (as a guest).
- A **Booking** belongs to one **Property** and one **User**.
- A **User** can write multiple **Reviews** for different **Properties**.
- Each **Review** is linked to one **User** and one **Property**.
- A **Payment** is linked to one **Booking**.

## 📌 Feature Breakdown

### 🔹 User Management
Includes secure authentication, authorization, and profile management. Users can sign up, log in, and update their profiles while ensuring their data is protected.

### 🔹 Property Management
Property owners can list, update, and manage their properties with detailed descriptions and images. This feature ensures a smooth experience for hosts to maintain accurate and attractive listings.

### 🔹 Booking System
Enables users to search, reserve, and manage bookings for available properties. The system handles availability, confirmation, and cancellation seamlessly.

### 🔹 Payment Processing
Provides a secure and reliable way to handle online transactions. Supports multiple payment methods while ensuring data security and fraud prevention.

### 🔹 Review System
Allows guests to leave feedback and ratings for properties after their stay. This feature builds trust and helps future users make informed decisions.

‎## 🔐 API Security
‎
‎Security is a top priority in this project to ensure that sensitive data and financial transactions are protected. The following measures are implemented:
‎
‎### 1. Authentication  
‎- **What it is**: Ensures that only registered users can access the system by using secure login methods (e.g., JWT tokens, OAuth2).  
‎- **Why it matters**: Prevents unauthorized access to user accounts, safeguarding personal data and private information.  
‎
‎### 2. Authorization  
‎- **What it is**: Controls what authenticated users can do (e.g., guests can book, hosts can manage properties, admins can oversee).  
‎- **Why it matters**: Ensures users only have access to the resources and actions they are permitted to, preventing misuse or fraud.  
‎
‎### 3. Rate Limiting  
‎- **What it is**: Restricts the number of requests a user or IP can make within a certain time window.  
‎- **Why it matters**: Protects the API from abuse, brute-force login attempts, and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.  
‎
‎### 4. Data Encryption  
‎- **What it is**: All sensitive data (e.g., passwords, payment details) is encrypted in storage and transmitted over HTTPS.  
‎- **Why it matters**: Protects user credentials and payment information from interception or theft.  
‎
‎### 5. Secure Payments  
‎- **What it is**: Payments are processed through trusted gateways (e.g., Stripe, Paystack, or Flutterwave) with PCI DSS compliance.  
‎- **Why it matters**: Prevents fraud, ensures safe handling of financial data, and builds user trust in the platform.  
‎
‎### 6. Input Validation & Sanitization  
‎- **What it is**: Ensures all user input is validated and sanitized to prevent SQL Injection, XSS, and other attacks.  
‎- **Why it matters**: Maintains data integrity and prevents attackers from injecting malicious code into the system.  
‎
‎---
‎
‎✅ **In summary:** Security is crucial because it protects **user data** (personal info, account details), **financial transactions** (safe and fraud-free payments), and **system availability** (resilient against attacks). Without strong security, both users and the business are at risk.

## ⚙️ CI/CD Pipeline

### What is CI/CD?  
CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment) is a process that automates the building, testing, and deployment of the application.  
- **Continuous Integration (CI)** ensures that code changes are automatically tested and merged, reducing bugs and integration issues.  
- **Continuous Deployment (CD)** ensures that once code passes tests, it is automatically deployed to the production or staging environment with minimal manual effort.  

### Why it’s important for this project  
- **Faster development cycles**: Developers can push changes more frequently without breaking the system.  
- **Reduced errors**: Automated testing catches bugs early before they reach production.  
- **Consistency**: Ensures the application is deployed in a repeatable and reliable way.  
- **Scalability**: Makes it easy to handle new features, bug fixes, and updates without downtime.  

### Tools that could be used  
- **GitHub Actions** – Automates testing, building, and deployment workflows directly from the repository.  
- **Docker** – Ensures the app runs consistently across different environments using containers.  
- **Kubernetes** – (Optional) For managing containerized deployments at scale.  
- **Jenkins / GitLab CI** – Alternative CI/CD tools for automation.  
- **AWS / Heroku / DigitalOcean** – Platforms for deploying the application in the cloud.
